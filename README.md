> Get commit messages bewteen git tags or commit hashes.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save commits-between
```

## Usage

```js
const commitsBetween = require('commits-between')

commitsBetween({from: 'v0.0.1'})
// commits from tag v0.0.1 to HEAD

commitsBetween({from: 'v0.0.1', to: 'v0.0.2'})
// commits from tag v0.0.1 to v0.0.2

//=> return a Promise which resolves:
[
  ["title line", "full commit message"]
]

// since we use `git log --pretty=format:%s%b to get commits`
// so commit hash works too
commitsBetween({from: '73e7dab2b07e68b3', to: 'ee36f4bcc7bcaf'})
```
